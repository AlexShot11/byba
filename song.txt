I call upon the ancient lords of the underworld,
To bring forth this beast and,

Awaken, awaken, awaken, awaken,
Take the land, that must be taken.
Awaken, awaken, awaken, awaken,
Devour worlds, smite forsake

Rise up from your thousand year-old sleep,
Break forth from your grave eternally.

I command you to rise,
Rise...

I'm the conjurer of demons,
I'm the father of your death.

I bring forth the ancient evil,
I control his every breath.

I instigate your misfortune,
With the birth of killing trolls.

I awaken armageddon,
Feeding on a thousand souls.

Awaken

Musta-Krakish, (musta)
Musta-Krakish, (musta)
Musta-Krakish, (musta)
Musta-Krakish, (musta),

Awaken, awaken, awaken, awaken,
Take the land, that must be taken.
Awaken, awaken, awaken, awaken,
Devour worlds, smite forsaken

Rise up from your thousand year-old sleep,
Break forth from your grave eternally.

Weak will die and land will all be burned
Musta-Krakish king and death to worlds.

I command you to
Rise...
And awaken.
